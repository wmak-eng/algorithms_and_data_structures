    "This solution creates an algorithm that intakes a root node of a tree, and uses depth-first traversal via recursion to visit all the unique root to leaf paths in the tree. This solution works because it begins by appending the root node value to a list to start the path traversal, then uses recursion down the left branches and appends their node values until the base leaf is reached to complete a path. It then pops back up a node to traverse down the right branches and appends their node values until the base is reached again. This process iterates recursively until all node values are visited, which then ensures all root to base leaf node paths are tracked. "

    "In this module, we were required to use the algorithms and data structure concepts we learned in class and apply it to solving actual problems with binary trees. We first were given a problem statement with example inputs and outputs, and had to apply the correct data structure to get the required solution. In my case, I had to traverse a binary tree to find the closest duplicated node, and since it was a distance-based question, I decided to use breadth-first search to implement my solution. Next I reviewed the coding solution of my partner's assignment for a different question, which involved traversing all root to leaf node paths. That solution required a depth-first search approach and was implemented with recursion. I ran through the input examples on their coding solution and found that it worked correctly to produce the expected output. This process allowed me to understand how to solve different types of binary tree problems with different coding algorithms.   "
